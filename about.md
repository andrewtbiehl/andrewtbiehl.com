Hi, I'm Andrew. Welcome to my personal website! :)

I am an aspiring mathematician and former professional software developer who strives to
leave everything a little better than how I found it!

On my blog, I intend to share my ideas, opinions, and experiences related to everything
from building good software to the many mathematical rabbit holes I fall into. I'm a
slow and careful writer, so please be patient if I haven't posted anything recently.
This blog partly serves as an outlet for me to better formulate and understand my ideas,
but I also hope that you will find some of these concepts useful or thought-provoking
too. Thank you for visiting my corner of the internet!

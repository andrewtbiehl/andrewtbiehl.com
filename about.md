Hi, I'm Andrew. Welcome to my personal website! :)

I am a software developer with a background in mathematics who strives to leave the
software industry a little better than how I found it. I particularly enjoy discussing
practices and patterns that contribute to robust software, building tools that improve
the developer experience, and brainstorming with others who share these passions.

On my blog, I primarily intend to share my ideas, opinions, and experiences related to
building good software, but I may also sprinkle in some writings on math, philosophy,
and anything else I end up ruminating on. This blog partly serves as an outlet for me to
better formulate and understand my ideas, but I also hope that you will find some of
these concepts useful or thought-provoking too. Thank you for visiting my corner of the
internet!

## More about me

{: #resume-notice }

I've always been intrigued by the unreasonable effectiveness and elegance of formal
systems, which is why I primarily studied math and computer science while pursuing my
undergraduate degree at [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu). Among my favorite
classes from undergrad include Galois Theory, where I discovered how
[an abstruse field of mathematics proves it is impossible to physically trisect an angle with a compass and straightedge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_theory#Application_to_classical_problems),
and Theory of Computation, where I learned that
[an abstract model of computation potentially sets concrete limits on the capabilities of our brains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis#Philosophical_implications)!
This idea of formal systems reaching out and putting a mark on reality is incredibly
compelling to me, and it has continued to influence my academic and professional journey
significantly.

I chose to pursue software development after college in part due to the prospect of
catching a firsthand glimpse of this intersection between the formal and physical world,
but also because it's quite fun!

Shortly after graduation in 2019, I joined [Optum](https://www.optum.com) as an
associate software engineer for the Government Programs technology department. Within
this department, I was fortunate enough to join the maiden team for the newly
established "Dojo" program alongside two other new hires. The Government Programs Dojo
program is an experimental incubator program for upskilling developers by placing them
on greenfield projects and giving them the freedom to experiment with a modern
enterprise tech stack. As a junior developer in the Dojo program, I seized the
opportunity to design and implement critical components of multiple promising business
initiatives, all while gaining practical experience in a wide variety of modern software
development concepts, including DevOps, CI/CD, and microservices.

In January of 2021, I was promoted to software engineer and began to take on more formal
leadership roles, culminating in the Digital Health at Home project. On this project, I
co-led a team of six to develop two back-end systems for supporting Medicare members:
one that allows members to request in-home test kits and another that provides them with
up-to-date personal medical history and recommendations. As part of this role, I led the
creation and refinement of the project backlogs and served as the team's primary liaison
with its product owners, scrum masters, and another third-party front-end development
team. After just two months of dedicated development, the first of the two projects went
live, marking the first-ever production deployment by a team led by Dojo program
graduates.

In December of 2021, I decided after some introspection to leave Optum and take a break
from enterprise software development, at least for a little while. Presently, I am still
deciding what the next step in my professional journey will be. Stay tuned for updates!

## Even more about me

In my spare time, I enjoy playing board games (especially
[Terraforming Mars](https://www.fryxgames.se/games/terraforming-mars)), running,
listening to podcasts, and
[watching old seasons of Survivor](https://youtu.be/Oql6JzG7KGI) (no spoilers please!!).
